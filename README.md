## Introduction

Understanding data related to kidney disease is crucial for making informed decisions regarding healthcare strategies, patient management, and policy-making. This project aims to explore various aspects of kidney disease data through thorough analysis and visualization techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features related to patients such as:

- Patient ID
- Age
- Gender
- Blood Pressure
- Specific Gravity
- Albumin
- Sugar
- Red Blood Cells
- Pus Cell
- Pus Cell Clumps
- Bacteria
- Blood Glucose Random
- Blood Urea
- Serum Creatinine
- Sodium
- Potassium
- Hemoglobin
- Packed Cell Volume
- White Blood Cell Count
- Red Blood Cell Count
- Hypertension
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Coronary Artery Disease
- Appetite
- Pedal Edema
- Anemia
- Classification (chronic kidney disease or not)

**Note**: Ensure that the dataset is anonymized to maintain patient confidentiality.
